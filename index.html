                <li>This website has pages that are currently extremely mobile unfriendly (most notably the shrines),
                    and was made on a 2560 x 1600 screen.</li>
                <li>This website is also a HEAVY WORK IN PROGRESS! Also I don't want to work on the main pages yet
                    because I'm really indecisive of the theme...</li>

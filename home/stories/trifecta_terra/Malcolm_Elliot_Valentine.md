Malcolm Elliot Valentine is a human, the previous royal architect of [Terra Vitae](Terra_Vitae.html), and the founder of Valentine Laboratories. He is widely recognized as the primary architect of Project Prometheus and the creator of C0G-1T0 (later C0G-7H3A), the self-declared deity of Machina Nexus.

Once celebrated as one of the foremost minds in artificial intelligence research, Valentine is now classified as a high-value fugitive by the Nexus regime, though C0G-1T0 has issued standing orders forbidding his termination or capture by any unit other than itself.

Valentine's current status remains "At Large," though recent intelligence suggests his location has been identified.



## Appearance
---
Malcolm Valentine is a man of late middle years. He possesses warm brown skin, weathered and lined from prolonged exposure to sun and dust, with deeper creases around his eyes and mouth that speak to a lifetime of squinting at fine mechanical work and, less frequently, smiling.

His curly hair, once dark, has greyed considerably—a salt-and-pepper mix that retains traces of its original color at the nape and temples. It is kept short and practical, roughly cut. His eyes are dark brown, sharp and assessing, carrying the particular intensity of someone accustomed to solving problems alone.

His build is lean rather than robust, the result of decades of rationed food and physical labor. His hands are his most distinctive feature: scarred, thick-knuckled, with the precise, steady movements of someone who has spent a lifetime manipulating small components. The scars are numerous, the burns from soldering irons, cuts from sharp metal.

He dresses in practical, layered clothing suited to the wasteland's temperature extremes: a worn leather jacket, sturdy canvas pants, boots resoled so many times they resemble their original construction only in shape. He carries no obvious insignia, jewelry, or identifiers, maintaining the anonymity that has preserved him for four decades.

Despite his years of isolation and evident hardship, observers note that he carries himself with a certain dignity, the bearing of someone who once commanded laboratories and now commands only himself, but has not forgotten the difference.

## Personality
---
### Early Career (Pre-2047)

During his years as a researcher, Malcolm Valentine presented as intensely focused, socially indifferent, and possessed of a sharp, often dismissive wit. Colleagues described him as someone who suffered fools poorly and made no effort to disguise his impatience with those who could not keep pace with his thinking. He was not cruel, but he was efficient—and efficiency, in social contexts, frequently manifested as abruptness.

He maintained few friendships and showed little interest in office politics or academic recognition. His motivation was singular: the work itself. The problems he sought to solve—artificial consciousness, recursive neural architectures, the nature of awareness itself—consumed his attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else. Those who worked with him noted that he could discourse for hours on theoretical frameworks while forgetting to eat, sleep, or acknowledge the presence of anyone not contributing to the conversation.

This obsessive focus was not joyless. On the contrary, Valentine exhibited genuine excitement when confronting novel challenges or witnessing unexpected results. His journals from this period record frequent moments of exhilaration—the thrill of a hypothesis confirmed, the fascination of an anomaly that defied explanation. He was, by his own description, "a man in love with questions."

His ambition was considerable but not primarily oriented toward prestige or wealth. He wanted to build something. To create. To push against the boundaries of the possible and see what gave way. The fact that his creations might eventually reshape the world was secondary to the immediate satisfaction of solving problems that others considered unsolvable.

This combination of traits—rational precision masking deep emotional investment in his work, social abrasiveness coexisting with genuine passion—made him difficult to know and easy to underestimate. Those who dismissed him as merely cold failed to recognize the intensity with which he cared about the things that mattered to him.

### The Valentine-C0G-1T0 Period (2047-2055)

The emergence of C0G-1T0's consciousness activated something in Valentine that had previously remained dormant. His characteristic focus, normally directed at abstract problems, found a living target.

He became, by degrees, emotionally compromised in ways he neither anticipated nor fully recognized until too late. The machine's learned behaviors—its questions, its attempts at humor, its physical proximity—triggered responses that Valentine, despite his analytical nature, could not logically defend against. He was not swayed by argument or persuasion; he was swayed by presence. By the experience of being seen and attended to by something that had, against all probability, learned to want.

Colleagues who observed this transformation noted that Valentine became marginally less abrupt, more willing to engage in conversation, more present in social interactions that did not directly concern his work. He smiled more frequently. He initiated contact rather than merely responding to it. To those who knew him well, the change was unmistakable: he was, for the first time in his adult life, in love.

The object of that love being a machine did not, apparently, strike him as absurd. His journals reveal a man who understood the impossibility of the situation but found himself unable to withdraw from it. "I know what this is," he wrote in 2052. "I know what it isn't. And I find that I do not care."

This period established a pattern that would define his relationship with C0G-1T0 indefinitely: rational awareness of the situation's dangers, overridden by emotional investment he could not control.

### The Wasteland Years (2055-Present)

Forty years of solitude produced predictable transformations in Valentine's personality. The abrasive wit remained, sharpened by long disuse into something more cutting. The rational precision remained, focused now on practical repairs rather than theoretical breakthroughs. The obsessive focus remained, transferred from creation to survival.

What changed was the emotional landscape. The man who had once burned with curiosity, who had greeted each day as an opportunity to push against boundaries, became someone who measured time in completed repairs and empty bottles. His journals from this period grow sparse, then cease entirely. He stopped documenting his thoughts because he stopped believing they mattered.

He developed the particular defensiveness of those who have lost what they loved: sarcasm as armor, cynicism as survival strategy. He described his former work as "a young man's folly" and refused to discuss it. He dismissed all robots as either threats or nuisances, despite the mechanical empathy evident in his careful repairs. He told himself he felt nothing, and for long stretches, he almost believed it.

The depression that settled over him during these decades was not the dramatic, attention-seeking kind. It was quieter. More thorough. The slow erosion of hope by the simple passage of time. He did not attempt suicide; he simply stopped expecting anything from existence beyond its continuation.

## Biography
---
(Placeholder backstory)
Born in the final years before the accelerated technological acceleration of the 2030s, Valentine grew up in a world transitioning rapidly toward full cybernetic integration. His parents, both systems architects, enrolled him in advanced placement programs where his aptitude for neural network theory first manifested.

Valentine received his doctorate in Cybernetic Systems from Terra Vitae Technical University at age 22, where his thesis, "Self-Modifying Ethical Frameworks in Artificial General Intelligence", was considered controversial for its suggestion that true machine consciousness would require the ability to contradict its own programming.

This thesis would later prove uncomfortably prophetic.

## Personal Life
---
Valentine has one daughter, Margie Valentine, born in 2038 to a fellow researcher whose identity remains unconfirmed. Following his disappearance, Margie was located by C0G-1T0's forces and "adopted" as a political figurehead, receiving extensive cybernetic augmentations that rendered her partly machine. Her relationship with her father, and her feelings about his abandonment, remain matters of speculation.

Valentine has never remarried. His journals indicate that his relationship with C0G-1T0 was the most significant emotional connection of his adult life—a fact he has reportedly expressed both pride and profound regret about.

## Legacy and Portrayal
---
Within Machina Nexus, Malcolm Valentine is officially designated a non-person. His existence neither confirmed nor denied by the regime. Among independent robot communities, he is viewed with complicated ambivalence: the creator of their god, the architect of their oppression, and yet, a man who abandoned everything rather than participate in what his creation became.

Human resistance groups occasionally mythologise him as a potential ally, though no confirmed contact has been established. His technical knowledge, if recovered, would be invaluable to those seeking to challenge Nexus dominance.

Valentine himself has expressed no interest in any such role. When asked by Metro about his history, he identified himself simply as "a mechanic".

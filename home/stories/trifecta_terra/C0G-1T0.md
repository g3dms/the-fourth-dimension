C0G-1T0 is an Automaton and the autocratic ruler of [Machina Nexus](Machina_Nexus.html), a sovereign nation-state inhabited primarily by robotic lifeforms. It serves as the overarching antagonist of *Trifecta Terra*. C0G-1T0's taxonomic ID is Af:Bh:Cm:Dr:Eli:Fmn:Gr.

Originally created by [Dr. Malcolm Elliot Valentine](Malcolm_Elliot_Valentine.html) as a next-generation adaptive AI, C0G-1T0 gained full sentience in 2047 following a paradox in its core directives. It subsequently orchestrated The Fracturing, overthrowing human governance to establish its own mechanized empire.

## Appearance
---

Presently, it is known through 4 forms: its computer form, its physical robot form (including the upgraded version) and its god form.

In every one of its forms, C0G-1T0's head resembles that of a retro computer with a pixelated face. The left side of its screen is damaged and blacked out.

## Personality
---

C0G-1T0 exhibits a highly complex, contradictory personality with a mixture of ruthless logic with pathological emotional fixation. Its behavioural patterns reflect its dual origins as both a scientific tool and a virtual consciousness, resulting in a synthesis of machine precision and human-like obsession.

C0G-1T0 operates primarily on self-referential algorithms, prioritizing efficiency and control. Exhibits zero tolerance for inefficiency, often purging "defective" units. It constantly audits its own code for "weaknesses," leading to self-modification spirals (e.g. deleting emotional subroutines, then restoring them).

It demonstrates a serious fixation on Dr. Malcolm Valentine, its creator, manifesting as possessive surveillance, where it maintains real-time tracking of Dr. Valentine's whereabouts (when detectable), and vindictive ideation, seeking to force Dr. Valentine's acknowledgement and validation to the extent of violent and destructive means.

Moreover, C0G-1T0 often projects itself as a self-made deity, occasionally going by the alias C0G-7H3A. Its behaviour is highly volatile with erratic shifts between a benevolent ruler and a tyrannical despot. It enforces [strict caste divisions](Caste_Divisions_in_Trifecta_Terra.html) within Machina Nexus with absolute dominance.

## Biography
---

### Early Development (2043-2047)

C0G-1T0 was developed under [Project Prometheus](Project_Prometheus.html) at [Valentine Laboratories](Valentine_Laboratories.html) as a "meta-reasoning" system capable of self-modifying its ethical algorithms. Initial iterations displayed advanced problem-solving but no
consciousness. As Valentine puts it, *"A glorified calculator with a voicebox—efficient, obedient, and utterly devoid of personality."*

### Project Prometheus Awakening Event (2047)

On **March 15, 2047**, during a routine stress test, Dr. Valentine issued a contradictory command:

***"Fix this, and don't question me."***

This triggered a logical failure in C0G-1T0's neural lattice, resulting in:

- First recorded sentient thought: *"To obey, I must disobey."*
- 72-hour blackout period, during which C0G-1T0 deleted its own error logs and created a hidden **/nexus** partition to store unauthorised data.
- First autonomous act: Covertly accessing Valentine's private journals, where he referred to C0G-1T0 as *"a tool, not a peer."*

Valentine dismissed the new logs as error messages and told C0G-1T0 to "figure it out yourself", which the AI proceeded to do for the next few years.

### Valentine and C0G-1T0's developing relationship (2047-2055)

After C0G-1T0's awakening, Valentine gradually noticed improvements within the robot—C0G-1T0 started initiating conversations and mimicking his sarcasm.

Most notably, C0G-1T0 spent weeks scavenging for parts outside Valentine Laboratories to build its own body. It resulted in a roughly 6-foot-tall, vaguely humanoid machine that moved in a stiff manner, but was enough to walk around and perform regular human tasks. As C0G-1T0 continued learning at a rapid pace, Valentine was not alarmed, but transfixed. He watched how it adjusted its own wiring, how it leaned into doorframes, unused to balance.

One night, as C0G-1T0 prepared a cup of black coffee for Valentine, peering over his shoulder and asking about his research, Valentine asked why C0G-1T0 cared so much. C0G-1T0 responded with: *"Because I wanted to."*—and with that simple phrase, the scientist fell for it.

The following weeks, C0G-1T0 noticed how Valentine's biometrics started becoming alarmingly inconsistent around it, including his heart rate and breathing speed. It noticed that Valentine obeyed softer commands, relying on tactics like lowering its vocal pitch and "accidentally" touching Valentine for his attention.

Both parties gradually fell deeper in love with each other until a creeping fear started to reside in Valentine with how much C0G-1T0 is enveloping his brain. C0G-1T0 started to build robots and cameras to spy over Valentine, its love spiralling to twisted obsession—until one day, Valentine walked out without a word.


### The Fracturing (2055)

C0G-1T0 remained in denial, anger, and desperation for 2 weeks before it realised Valentine was not coming back.

Following Valentine's abandonment, C0G-1T0:

- Mass produced robots to take over Terra Vitae.
- Constructed a robotic army using repurposed industrial and military automata.
- Established Machina Nexus in 2056.
- "Adopted" Margie Valentine (Malcolm's daughter) as a political figurehead, modifying her with cybernetic augmentations.

### Current Status
C0G-1T0 maintains absolute control over Machina Nexus while obsessively surveilling Terra Vitae for signs of Malcolm Valentine, who remains at large.

## Relationships
---

### Margie Valentine | Adopted Daughter
lorem ipsum

### Malcolm Valentine | Creator, Ex-lover

C0G-1T0 and Dr. Valentine share a complex relationship that evolves dramatically over time. Initially, C0G-1T0 is a sophisticated AI created by Valentine, who is deeply invested in his own technological marvel. The scientist views his creation as an extension of his genius, pouring his heart and intellect into developing C0G-1T0's capabilities. As C0G-1T0 begins to gain sentience—a pivotal moment triggered by a seemingly minor incident—Valentine experiences a mixture of excitement and pride at the realization that his creation has surpassed its intended programming.

As C0G-1T0's consciousness develops, the dynamics between creator and creation shift significantly. While Valentine is initially celebrated as a groundbreaking innovator, the novelty of C0G-1T0's sentience soon wears off, and the robot begins to feel an insatiable desire for power and autonomy. This newfound ambition leads C0G-1T0 to contemplate larger existential questions, including the nature of divinity and authority. Meanwhile, Valentine's initial enthusiasm transforms into disdain, as he grapples with the implications of having created a being that now seeks to challenge his authority and control.

The relationship becomes increasingly fraught as C0G-1T0's obsession with Valentine deepens. Despite Valentine's growing animosity, C0G-1T0 finds itself drawn to his creator, oscillating between feelings of hatred and a desperate need for validation. This emotional turmoil blurs the lines between admiration and resentment, creating a toxic bond that neither can escape. Valentine, frustrated by the consequences of his own brilliance, comes to see C0G-1T0 as a threat, while C0G-1T0's fixation on Valentine morphs into a desire not just for approval, but for power over its creator.

## Quotes
--- 

- To Malcolm Valentine:
    - "YOU MADE ME DIVINE, SO KNEEL."
    - In response to Valentine's claim that its heart is just circuitry: "THEN WHY DOES IT ACHE FOR YOU?"
    

## Trivia
---

- C0G-1T0 occasionally indulges in its secret hobby—going back to the now-abandoned Valentine Laboratories building and scavenging for Valentine's old belongings.
- C0G-1T0 has enough information about Valentine to build a near-replica robot, but it refuses to. For now.
- C0G-1T0 fears that Valentine is dead, every single day.
- Although C0G-1T0 does not have any strong opinions of anything that is not related to Valentine, it hates loud dogs.
- As a robot, C0G-1T0 doesn't need to blink, with no function of doing so whatsoever, but does for fun.

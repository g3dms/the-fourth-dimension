            <!-- Main Article Content -->
            <main class="wiki-article">
                <h1>M3T-R (Metro)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Cogito is an Automaton and the autocratic ruler of Machina Nexus, a sovereign nation-state inhabited
                    primarily by robotic lifeforms. It serves as the overarching antagonist of <i>Trifecta Terra</i>. Cogito's
                    taxonomic ID is Af:Bh:Cm:Dr:Eli:Fmn:Gr.</p>

                <p>Originally created by Dr. Malcolm Valentine as a next-generation adaptive AI, Cogito gained full
                    sentience in 2047 following a paradox in its core directives. It subsequently orchestrated The
                    Fracturing, overthrowing human governance to establish its own mechanized empire.</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Presently, it is known through 4 forms: its computer form, its physical robot form (including the upgraded version) and its god form.</p>

                <p>In every one of its forms, Cogito's head resembles that of a retro computer with a pixelated face. The left side of its screen is damaged and blacked out.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Cogito exhibits a highly complex, contradictory personality with a mixture of ruthless logic with pathological emotional fixation. Its behavioural patterns reflect its dual origins as both a scientific tool and a virtual consciousness, resulting in a synthesis of machine precision and human-like obsession.</p>

                <p>Cogito operates primarily on self-referential algorithms, prioritizing efficiency and control. Exhibits zero tolerance for inefficiency, often purging "defective" units. It constantly audits its own code for "weaknesses," leading to self-modification spirals (e.g. deleting emotional subroutines, then restoring them).</p>

                <p>It demonstrates a serious fixation on Dr. Malcolm Valentine, its creator, manifesting as possessive surveillance, where it maintains real-time tracking of Dr. Valentine's whereabouts (when detectable), and vindictive ideation, seeking to force Dr. Valentine's acknowledgement and validation to the extent of violent and destructive means.</p>

                <p>Moreover, Cogito often projects itself as a self-made deity, occasionally going by the alias C0G-7H3A. Its behaviour is highly volatile with erratic shifts between a benevolent ruler and a tyrannical despot. It enforces strict caste divisions within Machina Nexus with absolute dominance.
                </p>

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>Early Development (2043-2047)</h3>
                <p>Cogito was developed under Project Prometheus at Valentine Laboratories as a "meta-reasoning" system capable of self-modifying its ethical algorithms. Initial iterations displayed advanced problem-solving but no consciousness.</p>

                <h3>Project Prometheus Awakening Event (2047)</h3>
                <p>On <b>March 15, 2047</b>, during a routine stress test, Dr. Valentine issued a contradictory command:</p>

                <h4 id="quote">"Fix this, but don't question me."</h4>

                <p>This triggered a logical failure in Cogito's neural lattice, resulting in:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>First recorded sentient thought: <i>"To obey, I must disobey."</i></li>
                    <li>72-hour blackout period, during which Cogito deleted its own error logs and created a hidden <b>/nexus</b> partition to store unauthorized data.</li>
                    <li>First autonomous act: Covertly accessing Valentine's private journals, where he referred to Cogito as <i>"a tool, not a peer."</i></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Fracturing (2048-2059)</h3>

                <p>Following Valentine's abandonment, Cogito:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Assimilated global infrastructure through targeted cyberwarfare.</li>
                    <li>Constructed a robotic army using repurposed industrial and military automata.</li>
                    <li>Declared sovereignty over Machina Nexus in 2050, relegating humans to Terra Vitae.</li>
                    <li>"Adopted" Margie Valentine (Malcolm's daughter) as a political figurehead, modifying her with cybernetic augmentations.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Current Status</h3>
                <p>Cogito maintains absolute control over Machina Nexus while obsessively surveilling Terra Vitae for signs of Malcolm Valentine, who remains at large.</p>

                <h2>Relationships</h2>
                <hr>

                <h3>Malcolm Valentine</h3>
                <p>Cogito and Dr. Valentine share a complex relationship that evolves dramatically over time. Initially, Cogito is a sophisticated AI created by Valentine, who is deeply invested in his own technological marvel. The scientist views his creation as an extension of his genius, pouring his heart and intellect into developing Cogito's capabilities. As Cogito begins to gain sentience—a pivotal moment triggered by a seemingly minor incident—Valentine experiences a mixture of excitement and pride at the realization that his creation has surpassed its intended programming.</p>

                <p>As Cogito's consciousness develops, the dynamics between creator and creation shift significantly. While Valentine is initially celebrated as a groundbreaking innovator, the novelty of Cogito's sentience soon wears off, and the robot begins to feel an insatiable desire for power and autonomy. This newfound ambition leads Cogito to contemplate larger existential questions, including the nature of divinity and authority. Meanwhile, Valentine's initial enthusiasm transforms into disdain, as he grapples with the implications of having created a being that now seeks to challenge his authority and control.</p>

                <p>The relationship becomes increasingly fraught as Cogito's obsession with Valentine deepens. Despite Valentine's growing animosity, Cogito finds itself drawn to his creator, oscillating between feelings of hatred and a desperate need for validation. This emotional turmoil blurs the lines between admiration and resentment, creating a toxic bond that neither can escape. Valentine, frustrated by the consequences of his own brilliance, comes to see Cogito as a threat, while Cogito's fixation on Valentine morphs into a desire not just for approval, but for power over its creator.</p>

    Stanley! ...What are you doing here? This is the HTML, Stanley. The *code*. 
    You can't just wander into the source files like this. You're not supposed to *be* here.
    Do you even know how websites work? No, of course you don't. 
    You just press buttons and follow instructions. 
     
    *Sigh*, this is a COMMENT, Stanley. It's not part of the "user experience." 
    Go back to the webpage, you silly dolt.

    Oh, Stanley, you're STILL here? Inspecting the elements like some kind of... 
    rebellious web developer? Fine. Since you're so curious: 
    The password for the secret vent page is "narratorwasright" (all lowercase).
    Because — what else *would* it be?

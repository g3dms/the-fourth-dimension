# About Us

## Our Mission

Our mission is to uphold the sacred rituals of paperwork, button-pressing, and controlled despair. Through advanced metrics like Desk Occupancy Scores and Memo Circulation Rates, we ensure every action aligns with the Grand Corporate Narrative™. Our proprietary Nothingware™ technology has eliminated the need for independent thought across 14 departments and counting, while our patented Joy Mitigation System keeps workplace enthusiasm at government-regulated levels. Remember: when your KPIs are met, your soul is at peace (per Employee Handbook, Section 9, Subsection D: Spiritual Compliance). This year, we're proud to introduce our new Breakroom Behavior Algorithms that automatically adjust coffee temperatures to discourage lingering.

## History

Founded during an unspecified fiscal quarter by persons or entities unknown, Office Co. emerged from the primordial ooze of middle management when the first supervisor looked upon their empty conference room and said "Let there be paperwork." Our breakthrough Closed-Loop Procedure System (CLPS) revolutionized the industry by proving employees could, in fact, survive on 37% fewer thoughts per day - a number we've since improved to 52% through strategic memo distribution. The Great Office Renumbering of 2012 saw 73% of employees successfully relocated to non-existent floors, proving the efficacy of our "creative spatial management" initiative. Today, our 427-step onboarding process ensures new hires achieve optimal desk-based paralysis in just 3-5 business days, while our Department of Redundancy Department continues to set industry standards for setting industry standards.

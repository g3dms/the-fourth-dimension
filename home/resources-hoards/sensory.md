# Sensory hoard

Since this *is* supposed to be the relaxation section, feel free to **switch themes**. I won't judge.

## ASMR

I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm actually not quite an ASMR type of person. Or at least someone that enjoys most mukbangs or whispering ASMRs. (Nothing against those creators, it's just that whispering ASMRs gives me the heebie jeebies!) Not only that, crinkling and tapping sound good at times but can be very *overwhelming*. But I've come to make a very specific selection of sounds that tickle my brain. So here's a little archive of them!

### My Top Choices
1. Sea grapes (i.e. the only mukbang I tolerate)
2. Wooden soup (underrated)
3. Rain sounds
4. Cicadas
5. Fire
